# StableMatch
This is a simple java program implement a solution to the stable matching problem by Gale-Shapley algorithm. In our case, we will consider the problem of matching coop employers to coop students. In particular, we consider the problem of n employers and n students where each employer will hire a single student. Each employer produces a ranking of students according to their preference to hire for the coop term and each student rank all employers according to their preference to work for. Based on these preferences your mission is to write a program that will match each employer with one student such that all players will be as satisfied as possible with their match .
